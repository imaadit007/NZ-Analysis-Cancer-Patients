# NZ-Analysis-Cancer-Patients Analysis


Hey there! Welcome to this little project where I took a dive into a dataset about cancer patients in New Zealand. The main goal was really just to explore the data, see what patterns I could find, and try to understand the patient journeys a bit better using Python.
